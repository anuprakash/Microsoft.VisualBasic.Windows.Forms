Used in the popular application Modio.

A control for the .Net framework that mimics the functionality of Google Chrome's tab strip.

Allows a lot of the features you've come to know and love about the Chrome tab bar, including
the ability to reopen closed tabs and pin tabs.

The control is extremely customizable and the individual tab pages have various settings and
overridable methods to get your program and pages to do exactly what you want them to do.
